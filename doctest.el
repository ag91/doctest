;;; Commentary:

;; These are like a Python "doctest", but for Emacs Lisp and with an Emacs
;; twist. A doctest is a test written inside a docstring.  They look like:
;;
;; >> (+ 1 1)
;; => 2
;;
;; Inline comments are fine, but quotation marks must be escaped:
;;
;; >> (concat nil \"Hello world\")  ; concat should ignore nils
;; => \"Hello world\"               ; ...and return a string
;;
;; Some benefits:
;; - It's a clean way to test elisp code without any heavy dependencies
;; - It encourages functions that are pure or at least side-effect-free
;; - Your unit tests turn into documentation that your users can read!
;;
;; Type M-x doctest RET to run doctests on an entire buffer.
;; Type M-x doctest-here RET to run the doctest on the current line.
