* Description
  These are like a [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html][Python "doctest"]], but for Emacs Lisp and with an Emacs
  twist. A doctest is a test written inside a docstring that looks like:

  #+begin_src elisp
  "Return sum of any number of arguments, which are numbers or markers.
  >> (+ 1 1)
  => 2"
  #+end_src

  There are benefits:
  - It's a clean way to test elisp code without any heavy dependencies
  - It encourages functions that are pure or at least side-effect-free
  - Your unit tests turn into documentation that your users can read!

* Usage
  - Type M-x doctest RET to run doctests on an entire buffer.
  - Type M-x doctest-here RET to run the doctest on the current line.
  - Type M-x customize-group RET doctest RET to see customizables.
